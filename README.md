5. start - Start the server in prod mode
6. start:dev - Start the server in dev mode
7. lint - Lint the TS files with eslint

## HTTPS Support

You can run this api over https now with the help of [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) reverse proxy

Steps to enable HTTPS:

1. [Download](https://caddyserver.com/download) and setup Caddy
2. Open a new terminal and run `caddy run Caddyfile` in the root of project
3. Enjoy API over HTTPS now üëç

In future will move Caddy to Docker, so we dont need to install it seperately
